## Environment

The code is implemented in Python 3.9.0. All required packages to run the code are listed in `requirements.txt`.

`Unified_graph_variant.py` is the ablation variant designed to validate the mechanism-parallel design of graph construction.

`write_cfg.py` specifies the target date for forecasting.

`layer.py` and `net.py` define the model architecture.

`trainer.py` and `util.py` provide the functional modules used during model training and execution.

`eval_func.py` describes the design of the evaluation metrics.

`WIS_RE.py` evaluates the WIS score of CESGCN, compared with the FluSight_baseline and FluSight_ensemble models.
